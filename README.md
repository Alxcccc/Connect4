# Connect 4

This is a replication of the game commonly known as Connect 4.


## Technologies

## Game Rules
Objective: Connect four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Board: The game is played on a board with 6 rows and 7 columns.

Players: Two players, each with 21 discs of one color (typically red or yellow).

Turns: Players take turns dropping a disc into their chosen column. The disc will fall to the lowest available position in that column.
